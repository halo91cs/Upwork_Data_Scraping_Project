Data Scraping and Manipulation

<p>I want to create a database of physicians in Florida, divided into different specialties.</p>
<p>All of the data that I want to include is available, but not from one document.</p>
<p>Two lists will have to data extracted merged into one document.</p>

<p>All of the licensed physicians in Florida are listed on the Depart of Health’s website. (https://appsmqa.doh.state.fl.us/MQASearchServices/HealthCareProviders) It includes the Name, Address, and Personal Email Address for each doctor.</p>

<p>The major insurance companies’ list their providers by specialty. (https://provider.bcbs.com/app/public/#/one/city=&state=&postalCode=&country=&insurerCode=BCBSA_I&brandCode=BCBSANDHF&alphaPrefix=&bcbsaProductId) They list the doctor’s name, address, phone, fax, and usually the website. The only thing missing is the doc's personal email. That resides in the first list.</p>
